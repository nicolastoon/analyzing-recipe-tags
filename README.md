# Investigating the Significance of Recipe Tags
<p style="text-align:center;">a DSC 80 project â€” Nicolas Toon</p>

### <strong>Introduction</strong>
Food is undoubtedly a significant part of human lives. We eat food to survive, yet it can be a significant detriment to our lives with too much consumption, as seen by the obesity epidemic in the United States. One solution to controlling consumption is cooking, so that the amount of ingredients and macronutrients can be controlled. Online recipes can be a great method to find something simple and quick to prep, yet healthy to eat.

Similar to social media, most online recipes contain tags that help expand their outreach. The question I pose and strive to answer is: do more tags on a post lead to higher ratings?

In this project, I examined two datasets originally scraped by <a href='https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/pdfs/emnlp19c.pdf'>Majumder, et al.</a>, which compiled recipe details and reviews posted on <a href='https://www.food.com/'>food.com</a> from 2008 to 2018.

The first dataset, <code>recipes</code>, contains 83,782 rows, with each row denoting a unique recipe. Each unique recipe has 12 features:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Feature</th>
    <th>Data Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'name'</code></td>
    <td><code>str</code></td>
    <td>recipe name</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'id'</code></td>
    <td><code>int64</code></td>
    <td>unique identifier</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'minutes'</code></td>
    <td><code>int64</code></td>
    <td>estimated time</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'contributor_id'</code></td>
    <td><code>int64</code></td>
    <td>unique identifier for user who posted the recipe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'submitted'</code></td>
    <td><code>str</code></td>
    <td>posting date</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'tags'</code></td>
    <td><code>str</code></td>
    <td>recipe tags</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'nutrition'</code></td>
    <td><code>str</code></td>
    <td>nutritional information</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'n_steps'</code></td>
    <td><code>int64</code></td>
    <td>number of steps</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'steps'</code></td>
    <td><code>str</code></td>
    <td>steps for recipe, in order</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'description'</code></td>
    <td><code>str</code></td>
    <td>user generated description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'ingredients'</code></td>
    <td><code>str</code></td>
    <td>ingredients used</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'n_ingredients'</code></td>
    <td><code>int64</code></td>
    <td>number of ingredients</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The second dataset, <code>interactions</code>, contains 731,927 rows, with each row denoting a unique review. Each unique review has 5 features:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Feature</th>
    <th>Data Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'user_id'</code></td>
    <td><code>int64</code></td>
    <td>unique identifier for reviewer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'recipe_id'</code></td>
    <td><code>int64</code></td>
    <td>unique identifier for the recipe the review is about</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'date'</code></td>
    <td><code>str</code></td>
    <td>review date</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'rating'</code></td>
    <td><code>int64</code></td>
    <td>rating given</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'review'</code></td>
    <td><code>str</code></td>
    <td>review/comment text</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### <strong>Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</strong>
#### <b>Data Cleaning</b>
To make the data exploration process easier, the following steps were executed, in order:
<ol type=1>
  <li>Left merging the <code>recipes</code> and <code>interactions</code> datasets on the recipe id</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This matches each review with its corresponding recipe, making it easier to associate ratings with recipes.</li>
    </ul>


  <li>Replacing all zeroes with <code>np.nan</code></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Any entry of 0 does not make sense for each of the features, so 0 can be assumed as "missing values". Thus, we can replace all zeroes so that they are not included in data analysis.</li>
    </ul>


  <li>Finding the average rating of each recipe</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking the mean of all ratings associated with each recipe allows us to generalize ratings from recipe to recipe.</li>
    </ul>


  <li>Keeping only unique recipes</li> 
    <ul>
      <li>Since merging resulting in duplicate recipes, and we only need to analyze recipes and not individual reviews, we can filter for unique recipes, so that recipes with more reviews don't count more than recipes with less reviews.</li>
    </ul>


  <li>Converting <code>'submitted'</code> to a datetime object</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Originally, <code>'submitted'</code> was a string, but by converting to a datetime object, we can manipulate the date easily.</li>
    </ul>


  <li>Converting <code>'nutrition'</code> to a list</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Originally, <code>'nutrition'</code> was a string, but by converting to a list, we can manipulate information from the nutritional values easily.</li>
    </ul>


  <li>Converting <code>'ingredients'</code> to a list</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Originally, <code>'ingredients'</code> was a string, but by converting to a list, we can manipulate information from the ingredients easily.</li>
    </ul>


  <li>Converting <code>'tags'</code> to a list</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Originally, <code>'tags'</code> was a string, but by converting to a list, we can manipulate information from the tags easily.</li>
    </ul>


  <li>Creating a column of <code>'n_tags'</code></li>
    <ul>
      <li><code>'n_tags'</code> is a column of integers that corresponds to the number of tags each recipe has, which will be useful in comparing recipes with more vs. less tags.</li>
    </ul>
    

  <li>Creating a column of <code>'year'</code></li>
    <ul>
      <li><code>'year'</code> is a column of integers that corresponds to the year that each recipe was posted, which will be useful for any time series analysis.</li>
    </ul>


  <li>Dropping any unnecessary/repetitive columns</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Any columns that contained repetitive information as other columns were dropped. In addition, any columns that contains unnecessary information (for the purposes of this project) were dropped.</li>
    </ul> 
</ol>

The first five rows of the cleaned DataFrame are shown below:

| name                                 |     id |   minutes |   n_steps |   n_ingredients |   avg_rating |   n_ratings |   n_tags |   year |

Because the columns <code>'nutrition'</code>, <code>'nutrition'</code>, and <code>'nutrition'</code> are lists within the DataFrame, we extracted the lists into separate DataFrames, with row order preserved (so the first row of the new DataFrames will correspond to the same recipe as the first row of the cleaned DataFrame). In <code>ingredients_df</code> and <code>tags_df</code>, 1 represents that the recipe contains the ingredient/tag and 0 represents that the recipe does not contain the ingredient/tag.

The first two rows of each new DataFrame are shown below:

<code>nutrition_df</code>

#### Univariate Analysis
To initially explore the data, I examined the distribution of ratings for recipes.

<iframe
  src="plots/avg-ratings-hist.html"
  width="750"
  height="550"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>

As the histogram shows, ratings are significantly skewed left. This implies that there are more recipes on that are rated a 4 through 5, compared to 0 through 4, creating a massive class imbalance.

I also examined the distribution of the number of tags for each recipe.

<iframe
  src="plots/n-tags-hist.html"
  width="750"
  height="550"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>

The distribution of the histogram is approximately normal with an approximate mean of 16.3 and an approximate standard deviation of 6.8. This suggests that recipes can be expected to have anywhere from 10 to 23 tags, using the empirical rule. In addition, the dataset seems to contain outliers that have over 40 tags!

#### Bivariate Analysis
For further exploration, I was curious about if there were any tags that became more popular as the years passed, so I plotted the proportion of each tag's usage over time.

<iframe
  src="plots/tag-props-line.html"
  width="750"
  height="550"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>

We can see that most tags don't have much usage, only making up less than 4% of all tags used. There are a few tags that are frequently used, such as <code>preparation</code>, <code>time-to-make</code>, and <code>course</code>. The line graph is a bit cluttered, so let's only take the five most variable lines (lines that have the greatest minimum and maximum proportion).

<iframe
  src="plots/top-5-line.html"
  width="750"
  height="550"
  frameborder="0"
></iframe>

The three tags mentioned earlier, <code>preparation</code>, <code>time-to-make</code>, and <code>course</code>, also have a lot of variance. The tag <code>60-minutes-or-less</code> had a big jump in usage in 2015! On the other hand,the tag <code>easy</code> actually had a great decrease in 2018, meaning the usage for the tag significantly dropped in recipes posted in 2018!

#### Interesting Aggregates
I was curious whether recipes with a certain tag had attributes that recipes without that tag didn't have. For this investigation, I utilized the <code>dietary</code> tag, and grouped recipes with and without the tag. Then, I took the mean of the nutritional values for each group. The aggregation is shown in the DataFrame below:

| dietary   |   calories (#) |   total fat (PDV) |   sugar (PDV) |   sodium (PDV) |   protein (PDV) |   saturated fat (PDV) |   carbohydrates (PDV) |
|:----------|---------------:|------------------:|--------------:|---------------:|----------------:|----------------------:|----------------------:|
| False     |          326.7 |                23 |            23 |             16 |              20 |                    26 |                     9 |
| True      |          292.6 |                18 |            23 |             13 |              17 |                    18 |                     9 |

The DataFrame shows that nutritional values in recipes with the <code>dietary</code> tag were consistently less than or equal to nutritional values in recipes without the <code>dietary</code> tag. This suggests that there is a difference between the two groups, but is this difference significant or not?

### <b>Assessment of Missingness</b>
By taking a look at the columns in the cleaned dataset, there are two columns with a significant number of missing values: <code>description</code> and <code>rating</code>
